# Password Generator Challenge

## USER Story

AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Description

In this challenge, I wanted to create a JS sheet that enabled the deployed page to generate a password that is between 8-128 characters. The password must contain one or all of the following: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters and/or numbers. I have provided all changes made in the JS script as comments on each section.

## Installation

I have provided 2 links at the end of this page that should be able to work on any device.

## Screenshot of Changed Code

I have attached the coding changes I have made from the orginial script. There were no changes to the CSS style sheet or the original HTML sheet. I did not include the original script in the screenshots.

## The Result

I have updated the JS script for this website to provide users to generate a random and complex password that is between 8-128 characters and contains lowercase letters, uppercase letters, special characters, and/or numbers. This should be accessible on all devices.
